## BLE Peripheral Add-on Source Code

This folder contains the source code to build the Peripheral role firmware for the Tlera nRF52832 add-on board. It is meant to be used with the nRF5 SDK v12.2.0. This folder is meant to be dropped directly into the ...\examples\ble_peripheral folder of the SDK. The firmware is built for the pca10040 board and s132 SoftDevice options using the "armgcc" method (gcc ARM compiler and GNU "make"). Detailed instructions for flashing the nRF52832 add-on board are in ["STM32L4_BLE_Bridge_and_OTA_Wiki.pdf"](https://github.com/gregtomasch/Tlera_nRF52_MCU_Add_On_Board/blob/master/STM32L4_BLE_Bridge_and_OTA_Wiki.pdf) located in the main folder of this repository.
