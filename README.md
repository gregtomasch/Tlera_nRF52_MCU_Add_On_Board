# Bring BLE Connectivity to Your Favorite MCU Development Board With Tlera nRF52 Add-on Boards

Microcontroller (MCU) develoment boards are widely used for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications. They are compact, powerful and highly versaile with a wide range I/O capabilities. The PJRC Teensy3.X family of products are highly capable and very popular. These were some of the first MCU development boards that brought transformative performance to the IoT Maker community in small form factor and at a reasonable price. Tlera Corporation offers a [family MCU development boards](https://www.tindie.com/stores/TleraCorp/) that were initially inspired by the Teensy3.2 but based upon ST Microelectronics' STM32L4 microcontroller.![alt test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5760946/35936194-677fc7dc-0bf7-11e8-8aba-164e4539fc1b.png)![alt test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5760946/35936276-9dd7b4b6-0bf7-11e8-9f23-42b35ff0d7db.png)The STM32L4 is an 80MHz ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller with an embedded floating point unit and a very rich I/O portfolio. Like the Teensy3.X family, Tlera's MCU development board is supported by a [mature Arduino core](https://github.com/GrumpyOldPizza/arduino-STM32L4) for easy application development.
